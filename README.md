This repository is dedicated to researching Continual Learning scenarios and strategies using the CicIDS2017 dataset and the Avalanche Continual Learning library.

## Introduction

Continual learning is an important aspect in machine learning and AI systems, where a model's ability to learn from new data without forgetting previously learned information is critical. This repository aims to study and explore the various continual learning scenarios and strategies that can be applied to the CicIDS2017 dataset.

## Data Set

The CicIDS2017 dataset is a public intrusion detection dataset that contains both normal and attack traffic data. It has a total of 77 attributes and 3,640,403 rows of data. This dataset will be used as the primary data source for the research in this repository.

## Library

The Avalanche Continual Learning library is a deep learning library that specializes in Continual Learning. It provides various functionalities that aid in the implementation of Continual Learning algorithms and models. This library will be used as the primary tool for the research in this repository.
